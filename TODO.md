# TODO

- add "win" condition of reaching the relic
- idea:
  - yellow relic spawns more boards
  - red relic gives more hearts/actions
  - blue relic gives more time (time pressure for tension of quick moves vs thoughtful optimization)
- handle boundary
  - .. die if you fall off the edge?
  - .. treat as wall?
